    * first official release, versioned “1.0”
    * refreshed `README.md` with tested installation from scratch.
    * updated `dataserver/*settings.py*` to reflect installation needs, with
      some more new comments for newcomers to (hopefully) understand better.
    * removed apps : deal,
    * deactivated apps : alambic (exact status to be cleared later)
    * new apps :
        + ucomments : REST API over django-comments (@freddylimpens)
    * updated apps :
        + scout (@glibersat) :
      	    - add a new `Place` model (from http://schema.org/Place),
              that contains the previously defined `PostalAddress`.
        + projects (@atiberghien, @glibersat) :
  	        - model changes :
                * `ProjectSheetSuggestedItem` becomes `ProjectSheetQuestionAnswer`,
                * `Project.location` is now a FK to `Place`, no more to `PostalAddress`,
                  thus `project.location.address` gives the previous value.
  	        - resources names changes:
                project/sheet/template → project/sheet/template
                project/sheet/question → project/sheet/question
                project/sheet/question_answer → project/sheet/question_answer
                project/sheet/projectsheet → project/sheet/projectsheet
    * refreshed `requirements` with stable releases following, where possible.
